# Flight Fare Prediction

## Overview
This Flask web app predicts the fare of Flight tickets, leveraging Machine Learning to provide accurate estimations.

## Motivation
During the pandemic lockdown, I began exploring Machine Learning to delve into the mathematical foundations of supervised models. This project represents the culmination of that learning, applying theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world application.

## Installation
The code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python, upgrade it using the pip package to ensure you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run the following command in your project directory after cloning the repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployment on Heroku
Create a virtual app by logging in or signing up at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). You can connect your GitHub profile or download the Heroku CLI to manually deploy this project.

## Bug Report
If you encounter any bugs, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname/issues) with your search query and the expected result.

## Future Scope
- Use multiple algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Optimize the Flask `app.py`.
- Improve the Front-End design to enhance user experience.
